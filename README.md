## 🧐 Why This Project?

Despite iPerf3 being one of the most popular and trusted speed testing tools, there are no proper, modern GUIs available today.
Most existing options are outdated, heavy, or tied to desktop platforms like Windows or Linux-only environments.

iPerf3-WebUI changes that — delivering a fast, lightweight, and fully web-based solution that runs anywhere Python 3 can: macOS, Linux, Windows, and even mobile (Termux on Android).

No messy installations, no clunky interfaces — just pure, streamlined performance testing from any device.

---

## ⚙️ What is iPerf3-WebUI?
iPerf3-WebUI is a parser and wrapper around the official iperf3 client.
It runs iperf3 as a background process, captures its command-line output in real time, and parses the results to present them in a modern, easy-to-use web interface.

Think of it as a lightweight bridge — combining the raw power of iperf3 with a clean, accessible UI for anyone to run network performance tests without touching the terminal.

No changes to iperf3 itself — just smarter, friendlier access to its results.
